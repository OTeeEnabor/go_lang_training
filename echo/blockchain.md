# Learn Solidity, Blockchain Development, & Smart Contracts

## What is a blockchain?
Smart contracts are decentralized agreements. More formally, a set of instructions executed in a decentralised way without the need for a centralised or third party intermediary. 

blockchains are blocked of from the real world. A closed system. They use an oracle to deliver information to the blockchain. 

Decentralised oracle network (chainlink) is needed to come the decentralised nature of the blockchain.
